# DeepSeek V4 (colibri CPU)

Local CPU inference for DeepSeek V4 Flash + DSpark on colibri: weight loading,
expert caching, sparse attention, speculative decode, and automatic RAM
tiering—end-to-end generation that passes smoke tests.

## Done

- **Target engine**: config / layer / attention / block / expert store / math /
  runtime / prompt; FP8 dense + native FP4 expert kernels; AVX-512 batch
  verify and rows16 hot-expert layout when available.
- **DSpark speculative**: draft runner, heads, verify window, prefix/commit;
  acceptance reaches 100% on the smoke prompt.
- **Automatic RAM policy**: plans resident tensors, DSpark stages, expert
  cache, and the output head from OS-available memory or `--ram`.
- **SSD expert streaming**: two coalesced reads per expert (scales + weights);
  no reordered 160 GB container required.
- **Source layout**: GLM-style amalgams `deepseek_v4.c/.h` and
  `deepseek_v4_dspark.c/.h`; `make deepseek-v4` builds `c/deepseek_v4.exe`.
- **CLI**: `c/v4` (Python launcher, stdlib only) wraps `run` / `chat`; inference
  itself is the native C engine.

## Model snapshot

Typical DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark shape (from checkpoint metadata):

| Item | Value |
|------|------:|
| Transformer layers | 43 |
| Hidden size | 4096 |
| Routed experts / layer | 256 (top-k 6) |
| Bytes per expert record | ~12.75 MiB (FP4 E2M1 + UE8M0 scales) |
| Sliding window | 128 |
| Dense resident (layers) | ~6.27 GiB |
| Routed expert payload | ~137 GiB (streamed; not all resident) |

Experts are packed FP4 (`float4_e2m1fn_x2` in I8 safetensors), not INT8.
Dense weights use E4M3 with UE8M0 block scales. Activations are FP8×FP4 with
FP32 accumulate on the reference path.

## Automatic RAM

Budget order: system reserve → runtime working set → minimum expert slots
(top-k × sparse layers) → optional resident BF16 lm_head (~1.06 GiB) → grow
per-layer expert-cache slots with leftover budget.

- Without `--ram`, the planner uses **OS-available** memory (not total RAM) and
  keeps an adaptive system reserve.
- With `--ram GiB`, that value is a **process cap**; no second OS reserve is
  subtracted from the cap.
- If the minimum expert working set does not fit, startup fails with a clear
  shortfall (no silent swap overcommit).
- Head residency is optional: low-memory modes stream the BF16 head; surplus
  keeps it resident for speed.
- Hot experts may be pinned and rearranged in place to a 16-row AVX-512 layout;
  cold experts stay official row-major FP4. Capacity does not grow from the
  rearrange.

Example residency under an explicit 32 GiB cap (current Flash-DSpark plan):

```text
dense ≈ 6.27 GiB
dspark ≈ 10.45 GiB
target expert cache ≈ 9.1 GiB (more slots when RAM allows)
head = resident BF16
```

At 8 GiB the planner can still produce a process plan when the **host** has
enough free memory for the minimum working set; decode is slower because the
expert cache is tighter. That is not the same as shipping on a physical 8 GiB
PC—see Bench.

## Bench

Hardware used for the numbers below:

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| CPU | AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 (16 cores / 32 threads, Radeon 8060S) |
| System RAM | 128 GiB |
| OS | Windows 11 |
| Build | `make deepseek-v4` (MSYS2 UCRT64, `-march=x86-64-v3`) |

Model: `DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark`  
Prompt: `--stop-sentence "What is the capital of France?"`  
(output: *The capital of France is Paris.*)

`--ram` here is a **process memory cap** on this high-RAM machine, not a
physical 8 GiB or 32 GiB PC. The **8 GiB row is a software limit only**
(`--ram 8`): the host still has ample OS RAM/page cache for SSD expert I/O.
A real ~8 GiB system may fail to start or run much slower once OS reserve,
runtime scratch, and disk cache compete for the same budget—do not treat that
row as a guarantee for 8 GiB hardware.

| `--ram` | TTFT | prefill | decode | DSpark acceptance |
|---------|------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 32 GiB | 9.57s | 1.403 tok/s | 1.236 tok/s | 100% |
| 8 GiB (cap only) | 10.02s | 1.338 tok/s | 0.712 tok/s | 100% |

```text
# --ram 32
[stats] RAM 31.98/32.00 GiB | TTFT 9.57s | prefill 1.403 tok/s | decode 1.236 tok/s | DSpark acceptance 100.0%

# --ram 8  (process cap on ~127 GiB host — not a physical 8 GiB machine)
[stats] RAM 7.55/8.00 GiB | TTFT 10.02s | prefill 1.338 tok/s | decode 0.712 tok/s | DSpark acceptance 100.0%
```

## Build

```bash
# MSYS2 UCRT64
export PATH=/ucrt64/bin:/usr/bin
cd /d/ai/colibri/c
make deepseek-v4
```

Or from the repo root: `make deepseek-v4` → `c/deepseek_v4.exe`.

Amalgamated sources are compiled per former top-level unit via
`-DCOLI_V4_UNIT_*` so onion `#include` + macro wraps stay correct. Shared
kernels (`native_quant*`, `safetensors_index`, `tensor_io`) remain separate
translation units.

## Run

```powershell
cd D:\ai\colibri
python ./c/v4 run --model D:/ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark --ram 32 `
  --stop-sentence "What is the capital of France?"

python ./c/v4 chat --model D:/ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark --ram 24
```

Or call the engine directly:
`.\c\deepseek_v4.exe <model> <prompt> --max-tokens N --memory-gb G …`.

### Options

- `--model PATH` (required) DeepSeek V4 checkpoint directory
- `--ram GiB` process memory cap; omit for adaptive OS-available planning
- `--ngen N` max generation tokens (default 128)
- `--stop-sentence` (`run`) stop at the first sentence terminator
- `--system` / `--thinking` (`chat` only)

Chat re-prefills history each turn; cross-turn KV reuse is not implemented yet.
Default non-thinking encoding:

```text
<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>[system]<｜User｜>[user]<｜Assistant｜></think>
```

## Todo

- [ ] **16 GiB performance**: close the decode gap vs 32 GiB (cache, pinning, I/O overlap)
- [ ] **Model quantization**: more aggressive weight/activation paths for footprint and bandwidth
- [ ] **Server**: HTTP / OpenAI-compatible API for multi-client use
- [ ] **CUDA**: optional GPU backend alongside the CPU path
- [ ] Chat cross-turn KV cache reuse (avoid full re-prefill every turn)
